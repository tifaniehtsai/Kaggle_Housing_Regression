# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques 
This project focuses on predicting housing prices using the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression technique. 

## Dataset
Competition Link: [Kaggle Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data?select=test.csv)
Dataset: consists of training and test sets, containing information about residential properties. 
Features: square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and other attributes. 
Goal: build a predictive model that best estimates the sale prices of houses based on the features

## Techniques
- EDA to understand the distribution of features and relationship with the target variable
- Visualizations such as histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots
- Feature Engineering to improve model performance
- LASSO regression

## Dependencies
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
